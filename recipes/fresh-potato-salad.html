    <h1>Fresh Potato Salad</h1>
      <img src="../img/potato.png" alt="The spud; underappreciated, unsung hero of the budget dinner.">
    <h2>The What</h2> 
      <p>I'd be quite happy to inhale a bowl of this for dinner, but for the more ascetic among you, this dish is a perfect side. Incidentally, it would be a brilliant accompaniment to <a href="./sea-bass.html">a fillet of pan-fried Sea Bass</a>; not to twist your arm, or anything. To prepare it, you'll need the following:
        <ul>
          <li>10-12 small new potatoes, cut into equal halves. No point scrimping - any leftovers can be stored in the fridge for a few days, as this recipe is dairy free.</li>
          <li>a generous handful of parsley, and around a half-handful of mint - both finely diced.</li>
          <li>4 anchovies, finely diced; you'll just have to trust me on this one!</li> 
          <li>around 2 tablespoons of olive oil, or for the liberal among you, a healthy glug. It's good for your skin!</li> 
          <li>the juice and zest from half an unwaxed lemon - wax and potato salad are, as one might imagine, strange bedfellows.</li>
          <li>2 confident pinches of rock salt, and a flamboyant application of cracked black pepper (preferably from an ostentatious grinder, if possible.)</li></p>
    <h2>The How</h2>
      <ol> 
	<li>First, as ever, your prep. Wash and halve your new potatoes. Dice your anchovies and set them to one side. Dice your parsely and mint, as finely as possible with 2 runs of the knife - if your knife is blunt or you're too overzealous, you'll bruise the herbs and leave the flavour on your chopping board. I'm sure you'll agree it's of little use there!</li> 
        <li>Add your potatoes to a pot of boiling, salted water. As with pasta, salty like the sea! Leave them to tread water while you prepare your dressing.</li> 
        <li>In a mixing bowl of size adequate to toss the potatoes later, combine your lemon juice, zest, olive oil, and anchovies. Anchovies are salty little beggars, so salt shouldn't be necessary - however, you may season to taste, as unfortunately for me you'll be the one eating it.</li> 
        <li>Once your potatoes can be speared easily with a fork through their thickest point, drain them and add them warm to your mixing bowl. Cover them in your dressing, and serve them warm with something delicious; such as, perhaps, the aforementioned <a href="./sea-bass.html">Sea Bass fillets</a>;hint,hint.</li>
