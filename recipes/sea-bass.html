    <h1>Pan Fried Sea Bass in Garlic and Parsley Butter</h1>
	<img src="../img/seabass.png" alt="Artist's interpretation of a delicious, but very much alive Sea Bass"> 
    <h2>The What</h2> 
	<p>Butter, parsely, garlic, and white fish. You're either a staunch defender of these combinations, or your haven't tried them yet. Seriously, turn up.</p>
	<p>To make it, you'll need to grab the following:</p> 
	<ul>
	  <li>2 Sea Bass fillets, from an affordable vendor of your choice</li>
	  <li>1 generous handful of finely chopped parsely</li>
	  <li>1 tablespoon of butter (and a generous glug of olive oil)</li>
	  <li>2 cloves of garlic, the more pungent the better (if you were feeling especially decadent, you could break down some confit garlic into the butter and oil, but I don't know your life.)</li>
	  <li>2-3 sprigs of fresh rosemary</li> 
	  <li>the juice and rind from half an unwaxed lemon (unless you have a penchant for lemon wax, which I can't say would compliment this dish.)</li>
	</ul>
     <h2>The How</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li>First, your prep. Finely chop your parsley, then dry your sea bass and place to one side.</li> 
	  <li>Add the butter and olive oil to the pan over a medium heat. The oil will protect the butter from burning, and the butter - well, I shouldn't have to explain that part. Heat until the butter stops bubbling.</li>
	  <li>Add the sea bass skin down, and lightly season wih some rock salt. Add the garlic and rosemary to the pan, and begin to baste. Cook for approximately 1-2 minutes, before turning. You want a light golden brown caramelisation on both sides - sea bass is delicate, and shouldn't be over-cooked!</li> 
          <li>Remove your sea bass from the heat. Give each fillet a squeeze of lemon, and a conservative dusting of lemon zest.</li>
	  <li>Tuck in. If I'm feeling especially enterprising I'll eat this on its own for lunch. However, for a light and delicious meal it goes brilliantly with some <a href="./fresh-potato-salad.html">Fresh Potato Salad</a></li>
