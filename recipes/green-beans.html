    <h1>Garlicky Green Beans</h1>

    <h2>The What</h2> 
      <p> Green beans are easy to overcook, as any who have had poorly mistreated green veg will attest. They deserve to be blanched in salted water, conserving their crunch and colour, and dressed in something obscenely garlicky. If you need telling, it's time to start treating your greens right. Here's what you'll need:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>2 handfuls of green beans, topped and tailed. That's more for aesthetics than anything else, so call me prissy.</li> 
         <li>1 precise squirt of lemon juice - no more, no less.</li>
         <li>a fey, underhanded dousing of olive oil - don't let them see, now.</li> 
         <li>1 head of garlic, roasted and squished. Yes, that's the official terminology.</li> 
       </ul>
    <h2>The How</h2>
       <ol>
         <li>You can take it from me - and I expect you shall! - that this is all remarkably easy, but very delicious. If you object to wasting the tops and tails of your green beans, then all you'll need to prepare is your garlick. Simply slice a couple of milimetres down from the stalk of the garlic bulb, exposing the flesh of the tops of each clove. Try not to waste too much garlic - it's far too precious - but do ensure you've sliced far down enough to extract them later, once they're roasted and gooshy. Again, official culinary terms only.</li>
         <li>Drizzle the bulb in olive oil, season with cracked black pepper and a pinch of rock salt. Now, wrap the bulb in tin foil and place in a pre-heated oven at 200 degrees celcius (for fan ovens, 220 otherwise.) It should be ready in around 25 minutes.</li> 
         <li>In a pot of boiling, salty water, blanch your green beans. The salt isn't just for taste - it will help conserve the green coloration of the bean. You eat with your eyes first, as they say! 3 minutes should do at a rolling boil - the beans should still have a crunch. Once done, drain and put to one side.</li> 
         <li>Once your garlic is roasted and tender, take the bulb - carefully! - from the foil. You might want to leave them to cool first, but if you're feeling brave then wrap a tea towel around the skin, and squeeze out the roasted garlic into a mixing bowl. Add the lemon juice, olive oil, and season to taste; it's really that simple.</li>
         <li>Dress your green beans in the warm garlic mixture, and try not to swoon from the savoury aroma. If you were trying to impress someone (who lacks the self awareness to abstain from garlic on a date) then I would suggest pairing this side with a <a href="sea-bass.html">succulent fillet of Sea Bass</a> and some <a href="fresh-potato-salad.html">fresh new potatoes</a>; just a thought.
